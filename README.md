## About

Hi, I'm Ashisha Konnur (he/him)! I have a technical background and hold a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Geoscience from Saint Petersburg Mining University, with a major in Seismic Data Processing and Analysis. I have 12 years of experience in the field of geoscience, where I held roles such as Data Processing Engineer, Head of Department, and CTO in a technological startup. After a year of transitioning from geoscience to Data Analysis, I am currently a Data Analyst at a Fintech company, starting from June 2021.
