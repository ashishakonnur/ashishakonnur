# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my portfolio

## About

Hello there, I'm Ashisha Konnur (he/him), a dedicated Data Analyst at Cognizant with a passion for refining and perfecting the world's leading navigation application (you know the one *wink). My academic background includes a Master's in Business Analytics from Clark University and a Bachelor's in Accounting & Finance from the University of London.

In my current role,
- I specialize in handling vast datasets, analyzing over 100,000 datapoints to conduct comprehensive statistical analyses such as ANOVA and t-tests. These analyses drive improvements in 'Point of Interest' accuracy across the US & IN regions within our pipeline.
- I pride myself on enhancing data accessibility and operational productivity by developing interactive dashboards in Looker Studio. These dashboards empower both management and engineering teams with actionable insights, thus facilitating informed decision-making.

Originally from Singapore, I made the leap to the US in 2019, driven by a desire to pivot my career away from the volatility of the Banking and Finance industry. Witnessing colleagues face job insecurity during the pandemic reinforced my resolve. It was during this time that my interest in Data Science was sparked by my experience with the Power BI dashboard implementation at work.

I'm committed to leveraging data-driven solutions to navigate through challenges and drive innovation in the tech industry. Let's connect and explore opportunities to make impactful contributions together.
